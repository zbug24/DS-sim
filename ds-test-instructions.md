# Running the script
Ensure that ds-server, ds-client, and your client are in this directory.
Run `ds_test.py`, passing the command to run your client as a string and -n if your client uses newline-terminated messages (i.e. Python or Java clients).
You can specify a directory of config files with -c (`TestConfigs` is used by default if you omit -c).
You will also need to specify your port number with `-p` (use a unique port number, like 5 followed by the last 4 digits of your ID).
For example:
```
python3 ./ds_test.py "python3 client.py" -n -p 50000 -c TestConfigs
```

To view the usage message that explains all options, use `-h`.
For example:
```
python3 ./ds_test.py -h
```

To speed up testing, results from the reference client using the configs in TestConfigs are read from `results/ref_results.json`.
However, if you want to try different configs you can make the script run them with ds-client and store the results in a new file.
The script will run ds-client when `--process_reference_client` is provided, and you can specify a new reference results file with `-r`.

**Warning:** this will take much longer to complete than just using the included `ref_results.json` file.
Only use this option if you intend to test your client with new configs.

For example (with a new set of configs stored in the NewConfigs directory):
```
python3 ./ds_test.py "python3 client.py" -n -p 50000 -c NewConfigs --process_reference_client -r results/new_ref_results.json
```

If the simulation gets stuck at one config (e.g. if the client gets stuck in an infinite loop), then the simulation can be killed by pressing CTRL+C *once*, skipping to the next config.
This should not be necessary for a correctly functioning client and will likely impact the results.

If you made a mistake when running the script (e.g. misspelled your client name or forgot `-n`), then the script can be killed by pressing CTRL+C *twice* within two seconds, you can then correct your mistake and run the script again.

# Output explanation
When the script is finished, it will print out three tables (one for each metric).
The leftmost column lists the configuration files.
The middle columns list the results of each baseline algorithm for each respective config.
The rightmost column lists your client's results for each respective config.
After the config rows, there is a row of averages and several rows with normalised values.
These final values are the average result of each column normalised against the average value of that row's algorithm.
The last "average" row depicts the average result of each column against the average results of all baseline algorithms.

The colour of values in the "Yours" column indicates your client's performance in comparison to the baseline algorithms.
Green indicates your client outperformed all baseline algorithms.
Yellow indicates your client outperformed at least one baseline algorithms.
Red indicates your client performed worse than all baseline algorithms.

The final results are shown after the tables.
- "Handshake" indicates whether your client has successfully completed the handshake with ds-server (and gracefully terminated with a `QUIT` message).
- "Scheduled At Least One Job" indicates the number of configs where your client scheduled at least one job (maximum of 3).
- "Scheduled All Jobs" indicates whether your client has successfully scheduled all jobs for all configs.
- "Average Performance" indicates that your client has outperformed the average of at least one baseline algorithm for all metrics.
- "Turnaround Performance" indicates the number of configs where your client outperforms all baseline algorithms for average turnaround time (maximum of 8).
